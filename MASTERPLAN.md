# 🎓 12-Month Data Science Masterplan

A **difficulty-weighted, project-driven** 12-month plan to build a strong data-science portfolio. Paced by cognitive load, not calendar days.

## Summary
- **Total time:** ~765 hours over 12 months
- **Outcome:** 10–12 GitHub projects, 2 deployed ML systems, interview-ready portfolio
- **Methodology:** Wave Learning Model (Learn → Apply → Project → Reinforce → Master)

## ⭐ Difficulty Weight Scale

| Difficulty | Time per Topic | Examples |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| ⭐ Easy | 1–2 days | Python basics, Jupyter, Pandas basics, visualization |
| ⭐⭐ Medium | 4–7 days | Feature engineering, SQL, evaluation metrics |
| ⭐⭐⭐ Hard | 10–20 days | Statistics, ML algorithms, NLP, time series |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Hard | 14–25 days | Bayesian stats, advanced NLP, ARIMA/Prophet, Spark |

## 🧠 Learning Wave Model

Each month follows this pattern:
1. **Learn** — Theory videos + documentation
2. **Apply** — Practice notebooks with exercises
3. **Project** — Real dataset implementation
4. **Reinforce** — Spaced repetition via flashcards
5. **Master** — Larger capstone every 2 months

**Key Principle:** Easy topics move fast. Hard topics get more time, repetition, and projects.
