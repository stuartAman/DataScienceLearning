# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Quick rules:
- Follow the branch strategy: `main` (protected), `dev`, feature branches: `feature/<short-desc>`.
- Use Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`.
- Open PRs against `dev`. Include tests for added features.
- Run lint & tests locally: `make lint`, `make test`.
