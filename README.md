# DataScience Masterplan

This repository contains a 12-month learning plan, projects, notebooks and reusable code to build a data science portfolio.

## Structure
- `notebooks/` — learning notebooks
- `projects/` — project directories (each with its README)
- `src/` — shared libraries
- `data/` — small sample datasets (ignore large datasets)

## How to run
1. Create virtual env:
   - `conda env create -f environment.yml` or
   - `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Launch Jupyter:
   - `jupyter lab`

## Contributing
See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for how to contribute and code style.
