**Total: ~765 hours over 12 months**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Environment (Windows)
```bash
# Run the setup script
.\setup.bat

# This will:
# - Create a Python virtual environment
# - Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
# - Set up pre-commit hooks (optional)
```

### 2. Activate Environment & Launch Jupyter
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Start Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab
```

### 3. Start Learning
1. Go to `months/month_01_python_core/`
2. Follow the **README.md** for that month
3. Work through notebooks in order
4. Complete the project
5. Update `resources/PROGRESS.md`

## 📖 How to Use This Repo

Each month folder contains:
- **README.md** — Learning objectives, sprints, and project description
- **notebooks/** — Learning Jupyter notebooks with code examples and exercises
- **projects/** — Real-world projects applying the month's concepts

**Learning Wave Model:**
```
Learn (theory) → Apply (notebooks) → Project (real data) → Reinforce (practice) → Master (capstone)
```

## 📊 Month Highlights

**Month 1: Python Core** — Master variables, loops, functions, and file I/O
**Months 2-3: Data Stack** — NumPy, Pandas, and visualization fundamentals
**Months 4-5: Statistics** — Hypothesis testing, distributions, A/B testing
**Months 6-8: Analytics & ML** — SQL, regression, classification, ensemble methods
**Months 9-11: Advanced Topics** — Feature engineering, NLP, time series, Spark
**Month 12: Capstone** — Build, deploy, and showcase your end-to-end ML system

## 📈 Track Your Progress

- Edit `resources/PROGRESS.md` to track completed months and projects
- Use `resources/checklists/weekly_checklist.md` to organize weekly goals
- Create flashcards as you learn for spaced repetition review

## 🛠️ Technologies Covered

## 🎓 Learning Tips

1. **Code along** — Don't just watch, write every line yourself
2. **Build projects** — Apply concepts to real data
3. **Review weekly** — Revisit previous material
4. **Document** — Write notes and summaries
5. **Share** — Explain concepts to others
6. **Iterate** — Refactor code as you learn better patterns

## 🎯 Your End Goal

After 12 months, you will have:
✅ 10-12 real GitHub projects  
✅ 2 deployed ML systems (API + Cloud)  
✅ Strong Python, SQL, EDA, ML, NLP skills  
✅ Portfolio that gets interviews  
✅ Interview-ready confidence  

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Run `.\setup.bat` to set up your environment
2. Read `months/month_01_python_core/README.md`
3. Start with `months/month_01_python_core/notebooks/01_basics.ipynb`
4. Follow the learning wave model each month
5. Complete projects and update progress tracker
